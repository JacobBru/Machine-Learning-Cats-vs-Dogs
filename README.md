**Machine Learning Cats vs Dogs**

This machine learning model utlizies a convulutional neural network with the help of Tensorflow and Keras libraries. The current model has a training accuracy of 85% and a validation accuracy of 75%. There is also an attatched testing file that takes in a single image file and prints to the consolse if the image is a dog or a cat.
